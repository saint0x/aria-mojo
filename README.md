# ARIA-1: First Training Run for Native Aria Computer Firmware AI

Initial implementation of ARIA-1, a native AI model designed for Aria Computer firmware integration. This Mojo-based system aims to provide local-first intelligence with hardware acceleration.

## Goal

Build the first model for **fully local operation** within Aria Computer systems. No cloud dependencies, no external API calls, no data leaving your device. Local intelligence embedded in firmware.

## ARIA-1 Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Native Firmware Integration**: For embedding in Aria Computer firmware
- **Local-First Intelligence**: Functionality without internet connectivity  
- **Hardware-Optimized Performance**: Target MI300X CDNA3 architecture
- **Universal Thinking Patterns**: Structured reasoning for tool interactions

### Target Specifications
- **Model Base**: LLaMA3.1-8B with tool-calling training
- **Performance Goals**: 310+ tokens/sec inference, 120-150ms training steps
- **Hardware Target**: MI300X with MFMA matrix instructions  
- **Memory Goal**: HBM3 bandwidth optimization
- **Training Plan**: 4-stage curriculum learning

## Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Pixi package manager
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Install Mojo compiler  
pixi add mojo
```

### Run Training Pipeline
```bash
# Navigate to build directory
cd aria-mojo-build/

# Run ARIA-1 training system
mojo run aria_llama_complete.mojo

# Run tests
mojo run final_validation.mojo
```

### Planned Training Flow
1. **Phase 1**: Dataset Generation (15,000 examples from 3,000 base templates)
2. **Phase 2**: 4-Stage Curriculum Learning (Foundation → Application → Integration → Mastery)
3. **Phase 3**: MI300X Hardware Optimization (MFMA acceleration + HBM3 striping)
4. **Phase 4**: Performance Validation 
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment Package

## Aria Computer Integration

### Planned Firmware Integration
ARIA-1 is intended for integration into Aria Computer firmware:

- **Boottime Integration**: AI capabilities on system startup
- **Hardware-Native Operation**: Direct GPU compute without OS overhead  
- **Firmware-Level Security**: AI processing within firmware boundary
- **Zero Network Dependency**: Offline functionality
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Consistent responses

### Target Features
- **Tool-Aware Reasoning**: Interact with system tools and APIs
- **Universal Thinking Patterns**: Structured reasoning 
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Understanding of system state and user intent
- **Real-Time Response**: Sub-second inference
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for embedded systems

## Status

This is experimental code. Nothing has been validated or tested on real hardware yet.
